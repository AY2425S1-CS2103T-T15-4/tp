**HRConnect is a desktop app for managing human resources in relation to projects.** While it has a graphical display, user interactions can be done by only typing.

* If you are interested in using HRConnect, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing HRConnect, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
