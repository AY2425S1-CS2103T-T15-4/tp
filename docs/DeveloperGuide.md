### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an employee).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Employee` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEmployeeList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Employee` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list and a `Skill` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Employee` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Tag` objects. Likewise, `AddressBook` only requires one `Skill` object per unique skill, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Skill` objects.<br>

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the .jar file and store it in an empty folder.

   1. Double-click the .jar file  
      - Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts, projects, and assignments. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the .jar file.<br>
      - Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting an employee

1. Deleting an employee while all employees are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all employees using the `listemployees` command. Multiple employees in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      - Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      - Expected: No employee is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      - Expected: Similar to previous.

### Other commands

1. Using / Testing other commands in HRConnect

   1. Refer to the [User Guide "Features" section](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t15-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#features) for formats, examples, and expected outputs for each command.
   2. Enter the commands with the provided format and parameter limitations.
      - Expected: The output performs the same as the listed expected output.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. With the app open or closed, find the data file in the folder you placed the .jar file, as `data/hrconnect.json`.
   2. Delete the file.
   3. If the app is not open, launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
   4. Create or delete any Employee, Project, or Assignment. 
      - Expected: A new data file is created at `data/hrconnect.json` containing the information in the app at the time.

2. Transferring data

   1. Prerequisites: Make some changes to the sample data (so it is different from the default entries, e.g. `addproject`).
   3. Copy the data folder at `data` (including `hrconnect.json` inside) into an empty folder.
   3. Copy the .jar file into this same folder (not into `data`!).
   4. Run the .jar file.
      - Expected: The changes you made are still displayed in the app.

## Appendix: Effort

HRConnect is based on the [AddressBook Level-3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) ([UG](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html), [DG](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html)).

### Challenges and Difficulty
Both AB3 and HRConnect deal with their stored data as entities (`Person` for AB3, `Employee`, `Project` and `Assignment` for HRConnect).  

However, HRConnect ended up as a significantly larger project due to the multiple entities involved (instead of only one). HRConnect also ended up more complicated in general due to the interactions between these entities. For instance, Assignment represents a link between an Employee and a Project, and we also had to deal with handling them in case of deletions to Employees or Projects.

Integration was also a challenge at the start, mainly due to some members' unfamiliarity with GitHub and Git. There were a few merge conflicts that we were able to resolve. However, we were able to mitigate much of the pain points by splitting the work up into relatively defined portions.

### Reuse
In the earlier stages of the project, some effort was saved by reusing certain parts of AB3 code. For instance, the code for adding and deleting projects was a heavily modified version of the original AB3 commands. 

Due to the increasing size of our project, we have since refactored certain parts (e.g. all three `list` commands) for better code structure.

### Achievements

We had a clear and defined vision of the requirements and features from the start, which helped with executing the implementation (coding) portion of the project.

We are happy to say we were able to match all of our milestones, even the earlier ones. 

We were also able to achieve a high level of test coverage for each Pull Request, and our features are confirmed to work well for the average target user so far.
